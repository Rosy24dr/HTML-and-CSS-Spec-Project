    <h1>Glimpse of my beautiful country!</h1>

    <p>Traveling through the most beautiful destinations in the Dominican Republic is a dream come true. The half-island has an impressive natural wealth that makes this land a magical place where you can disconnect from the tumult of the big cities and connect with nature. Is it a coincidence that many international films mention the DR as a destination for rest and vacation? No, it is not.

      The Dominican Republic truly has it all. This country has characteristics that make more than one fall in love. Although it stands out for its people, its athletes, its products, its projects, it also stands out for its natural resources and, above all, for its spectacular beaches with warm, crystal-clear waters that can be enjoyed all year round thanks to our climate.

      Even though we are in a reactivation process due to the COVID-19 pandemic that started at the end of 2019, currently it is not unreasonable to visit these destinations as mind-blowing as the DR beaches, because as filmmaker Steven Spielberg says, “you dream to live” and after the crisis, we all need dreams and plans. That’s why adventurer Carlos Torres (@carlostorresrd ) proposes visiting these five beaches that are loved not only by Dominicans but are a reference to this country in the world.

    <h2>Culture</h2>

    <p>The Dominican people and their customs have predominately European cultural origins consisting basis, with both African and native Taíno influences. The Dominican Republic was the site of the first European settlement in the New World, namely Santo Domingo, founded in 1493. Shortly after the arrival of the Europeans, African people were imported to the island to serve as slave labour. The fusion of European, African and Taíno traditions and customs contributed to the development of present-day Dominican culture.
